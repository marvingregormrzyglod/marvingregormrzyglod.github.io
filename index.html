            <h1>Game Developer & Bible Nerd</h1>
            <p>Marvin Gregor Mrzyglod is passionate about creating biblical content. He has developed blockbuster video games, pioneered practical use of [Self-Determination Theory](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/) and peaked when Sony entrusted him with design leadership of their oldest exclusive PlayStation franchise. However, he quit gaming to develop new ways of interacting with the Bible and let people experience scripture in refreshing ways.

  He has worked with a range of different languages and tools. The things he currently has the most experience with are: <mark>LUA</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, <mark>Unreal Engine</mark>, <mark>Anvil/Scimitar</mark> and his favorite <mark>GameMaker</mark> and its <mark>GML Script</mark>.

                
                With 10 years of experience in game development, 
            I specialize in [your skills]. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
